<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Manasvi Goel. I turned 19 years old this 
  December and I am a third year btech student. 
  I am persuing my btech degree from Dr Akhilesh Das 
  Gupta Institute of Proffesional Studies. Its located 
  in Delhi. I have to travel 1hr to reach the college. 
  But i enjoy the travel time with my friends in metro.</p>

<p>I am a sports person. I play badminton and football. 
  I recently took part in badminton competition although
   i didnt secure any position but i had a great experience.</p>

<p>I wanted to become a software engineer, and being punctual 
  and attentive are my characteristics as I never 
  arrive late for class. Generally, I do my work on my own 
  so that I inculcate the value of being an independent
   person. I always help other people when they are in 
   difficult situations.</p>
